# DigiKey_CompGen_Kicad
Uses the DigiKey api to create resistors and capacitors for KiCAD
associates a schematic symbol with:
  footprint (makes appropriate footprint if one does not already exist)
  Digikey part number
  manufacture part number
  datasheet URL
  Ratings (resistance, capacitance, voltage, power, etc)
  price at quantity 1
automatically gets cheapest component for each value
